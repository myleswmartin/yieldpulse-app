🔧 IMPLEMENTATION TARGET
------------------------
File to rebuild: /src/utils/pdfGenerator.ts

This file currently generates premium reports but needs to be completely 
rewritten to match these Figma designs pixel-perfectly.

📋 CURRENT PREMIUM REPORT FLOW
------------------------------
1. User completes property calculation on /calculator
2. User clicks "Download Premium Report" (requires authentication & payment)
3. System generates PDF using /src/utils/pdfGenerator.ts
4. PDF includes user-uploaded property reference image (stored in Supabase)
5. User receives professional 11-page investment analysis report

💾 DATA SOURCES FOR PDF GENERATION
-----------------------------------
The pdfGenerator.ts receives a complete report object with:
• Property details (name, location, price, rent, bedrooms, bathrooms, size, type)
• Financial calculations (all yields, cash flows, ROI metrics)
• Mortgage details (down payment, loan amount, interest rate, term, monthly payment)
• Expense breakdowns (DLD fees, agent fees, service charges, maintenance, etc.)
• 5-year projections (yearly cash flows, equity buildup, cumulative returns)
• Sensitivity analysis data (rent, vacancy, interest rate scenarios)
• User context (property reference image URL, purchase date, notes)
• Report metadata (generated date, report version, user info)

🎯 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
--------------------------
1. Study each design file carefully (PremiumReportCover.tsx through 
   PremiumReportSystemConstants.tsx)
2. Map dynamic data points to report object properties
3. Rebuild pdfGenerator.ts page by page using jsPDF and jsPDF-AutoTable
4. Ensure brand colors (#1e2875, #14b8a6) match exactly
5. Use Inter font family (already loaded in app)
6. Implement property reference image on cover page (fetch from Supabase URL)
7. Generate all charts using jsPDF drawing primitives or recharts + canvas
8. Test with real report data to ensure all calculations display correctly

📐 DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
------------------------
• Page Size: A4 (595pt × 842pt)
• Margins: Consistent across all pages (typically 40-50pt)
• Typography: Inter font, various weights (Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold)
• Color Palette: Navy #1e2875 (primary), Teal #14b8a6 (accent), Gray scale
• Header/Footer: Consistent branding on each page with YieldPulse logo
• Charts: Professional financial chart styling with clear legends

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES
------------------
• DO NOT modify these design files - they are reference only
• Property reference image is ONLY shown on cover page (page 1)
• All financial calculations are performed BEFORE PDF generation
• Premium reports require user authentication and Stripe payment
• Free reports have a separate, simpler design (not included here)
• Ensure number formatting matches UAE standards (AED currency, commas)
• Dates should be formatted as "DD MMM YYYY" (e.g., "15 Jan 2025")
